//! A collection of canyon-specific RPC methods.
//!
//! Since `substrate` core functionality makes no assumptions
//! about the modules used inside the runtime, so do
//! RPC methods defined in `sc-rpc` crate.
//! It means that `client/rpc` can't have any methods that
//! need some strong assumptions about the particular runtime.
//!
//! The RPCs available in this crate however can make some assumptions
//! about how the runtime is constructed and what FRAME pallets
//! are part of it. Therefore all node-runtime-specific RPCs can
//! be placed here or imported from corresponding FRAME RPC definitions.
